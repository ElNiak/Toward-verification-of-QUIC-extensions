Probleme avec ivy depuis le cleanup quic18_cleanup -> event qui disparaisse de quic_connection.ivy

Try:
change version, add some event that were deleted

quic_transport parameter uncomment:
        initial_version : version,  # holds negotiated version in encrypted extensions
        versions : vector[version], # empty in client_hello

Last version = 23: erreur quant installation 'api tls not found/modified, picoquic no version found

Test Quant version 29 by replacing version in quic_server_test
